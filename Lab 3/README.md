Ryan's Rapid Sports - Ryan Dunphy Lab 3 Submission

This lab is where we take the original idea from Lab 1 and create a working initial form of the website. The process is simple, but involves a couple of things that needed setup:

First, we needed to adjust the model to accomodate the methods and variables needed for the program. So I added the prescribed methods along with the validation necessary. 

Second, I adjusted the Controller to account for the new models and included validation for the model state. 

Finally, I adjusted the index file and the layout file to accomodate the adustments I needed to make. I also added CSS to make the page appear more professional (special attention had to be paid to the footer). 

Now, we have a working version of Ryan's Rapid Sports. This should serve me well in the labs to come.
